# JetsProject

# Description
This project reads from a text file that has a list of five jets and then puts all
of their information into the application. Once all of the information is stored
the user will be able to view the entire fleet of jets from the text file, view the fastest jet,
view the jet with the longest range, the user can add a jet to the fleet if they choose,
the user can remove a jet from the fleet, the user can fly all jets to see how many hours
the jets can fly until the jet is empty and it displays their speed in mach, the user can
load all of the cargo jets and then display which models are a cargo jet, the user can
deploy all of the fighter jets and then display which models are fighter jets, and finally
once they done they can quit the application.
# Technologies Used

# Lessons Learned
This project provided me with several lessons and new experiences. I further strengthened
my use of various different loops, such as the foreach, for loop, while loop, and switch loop.
While I have used these loops previously, this project helped make me feel more comfortable
implementing these loops. Something I learned that was entirely new was how to read from a
text file and then store the information into an array list and then access that information
within my application. I also strengthened my use with encapsulation and along with that,
made more comfortable with generating getters, setters and toStrings. I also was able to call and use
methods and classes more comfortably for this project. Something entirely new that was used for this
project was using interfaces and abstract classes. This project was very difficult for me but after
completing this project I feel much more comfortable with implementing the information I have learned over the
following weeks.
